Financial fraud, particularly credit card fraud, poses significant risks to individuals and financial institutions. Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, making it challenging to build accurate fraud detection models. Given a dataset containing transaction records, including fraud labels, the goal was to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions effectively.

Task:
The objective was to analyze the dataset, address class imbalance, and develop a classification model that can accurately distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The task also included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
The logistic regression model successfully detected fraudulent transactions with a reasonable accuracy. However, due to the complexity of fraud detection, further enhancements such as ensemble methods or deep learning techniques could improve performance. The project demonstrated the importance of data balancing, feature selection, and appropriate metric evaluation in fraud detection systems.
